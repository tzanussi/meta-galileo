I. Building the meta-galileo BSP layer
========================================

Get the clone-galileo script:

  $ wget https://github.com/tzanussi/meta-galileo/raw/daisy/meta-galileo/clone-galileo

Use the clone-galileo script to set things up:

  $ clone-galileo <dirname>

After running this script, cd into <dirname> and source the environment:

  $ cd <dirname>
  $  source oe-init-build-env

Add meta-intel and meta-intel/meta-galileo to BBLAYERS in
build/conf/bblayers.conf e.g:

  /home/trz/yocto/micro/meta-intel \
  /home/trz/yocto/micro/meta-intel/meta-galileo \

Add to build/conf/local.conf (before MACHINE ??= "qemux86"):

  MACHINE ?= "galileo"
  DISTRO ?= "poky-micro"
 
Build the image:

  $ bitbake image-micro

Create a bootable sdcard image:

  $ wic create micro-galileo -e image-micro

The output will tell you the location of the .direct image
Burn that to the sdcard and boot the galileo board from it:

  $ sudo dd if=micro-galileo-201404041056-mmcblk0.direct of=/dev/sdg

Just doing nothing will boot into the microYocto image.

The built-in IP address is 192.168.1.223.  To change it, you'll either
need to do it manually after boot, or change the meta-galileo layer
and rebuild.

ssh to that address and login as root with no password:

  $ ssh -l root 192.168.1.223

If you run into build problems, please make sure you have a sane build
environment.  Going throut the Yocto Project Quickstart first should
ensure that you do:

  https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html

There's also a whole host of other documentation there which may be of
interest:
